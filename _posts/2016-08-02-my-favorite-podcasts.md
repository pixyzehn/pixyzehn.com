I'd like to introduce you to my favorite podcasts in this article. They are almost all related to iOS development. If you're interested in that field, you may find a new podcast. And I intend to update this article regularly. <5/5> means a five star rating in my opinion.

<5/5>

\- [Build Phase](http://buildphase.fm/){:target="_blank"}

> Build Phase is a weekly technical podcast discussing iOS development and design. Hosted by iOS developers Mark Adams, Jack Nutting, and Gordon Fontenot.

Their topics are not only about iOS development but also about functional programming, Vim, [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} and so on. I really like their personality and the atmosphere in their conversation. Their episodes are less than 30 ~ 40 minutes, so these are very listenable for me.

\- [Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar){:target="_blank"}

> From development and design to marketing and support, Under the Radar is all about independent app development. It's never longer than 30 minutes.

Actually, I'm a big fan of [Marco Arment](https://marco.org/){:target="_blank"}. They're not talking about new things like a Swift's new feature now, but they have great knowledge of iOS app development and iOS market. I always use [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/){:target="_blank"} that Marco created.

\- [Runtime](http://spec.fm/podcasts/runtime){:target="_blank"}

> Sam Soffes and Caleb Davenport talk about Swift, iOS, and other things they like.

I think this is newer podcast than others. They discuss Swift's new proposal and hot news in Swift developing. If you catch up with new features in Swift 3 and 4, I recommend to listen this podcast. Personally, I like the introduction music in this podcast:)

<4/5>

\- [SharedInstance](http://sharedinstance.com/){:target="_blank"}

> A podcast about iOS Development from three iOS Developers based in Cincinnati, OH

\- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/){:target="_blank"}

> Open Source moves fast. Keep up.

I don't listen to all episodes usually. If anything, I listen to the episode that I'm interested in.

\- [CocoaConf Podcast](http://cocoaconf.com/podcast){:target="_blank"}

> The CocoaConf Podcast features members of the iOS and OS X community offering tips, insight, facts, and opinions for other iOS and OS X developers. You’ll recognize many of the voices from the popular CocoaConf conference series.

\- [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/){:target="_blank"}

> A podcast about indie software development for the Mac, iOS and other Apple technologies.

\- [The raywenderlich.com Podcast](https://www.raywenderlich.com/rwpodcast){:target="_blank"}

> Join Mic and Jake as they discuss every aspect of app development with well-known characters from the developer community. Primarily focusing on Apple technology, but with the occasional dip into other platforms.

\- [Release Notes](https://releasenotes.tv/aboutthepodcast/){:target="_blank"}

> Release Notes is a weekly podcast about the business of Mac and iOS indie software development. We discuss inspiration, design, trends, and tools — everything but the code. The show is hosted by Charles Perry, owner of Metakite Software, and Joe Cieplinski, Creative Director of Bombing Brain Interactive.

\- [The iPhreaks Show](https://devchat.tv/iphreaks){:target="_blank"}

> The iPhreaks Show is a weekly group discussion about iOS development and related technology by development veterans. We discuss Apple, tools, practices, and code.

<3/5>

> A multimedia show about creating, using Swift and other Apple technologies.

\- [SwiftCoders](http://swiftcoders.podbean.com/){:target="_blank"}
