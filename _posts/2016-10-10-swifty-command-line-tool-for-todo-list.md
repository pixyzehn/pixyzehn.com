I'll introduce a simple command-line tool that I made called `stodo` just for myself. To create command-line tool was first time experience for me. To be honest, it was really fun and comfortable because I don't need to stuck UI staffs. The repository is here.

[pixyzehn/stodo](https://github.com/pixyzehn/stodo){:target="_blank"}

`stodo` means Swifty todo. So I developed this by using Swift3.0. I chose [Commandant](https://github.com/Carthage/Commandant){:target="_blank"} as a framework for parsing command-line arguments. Keep in mind that don't forget add version in `Cartfile` when you use `Commandant` because its latest version is `0.11.1` but it also has higher version like `5.0.2`. If you don't add the version, you'll install higher version against your will. I noticed it through TravisCI test.

```
// Cartfile
github "Carthage/Commandant" ~> 0.11
```

Now you can install by `make install` after `git clone`.   

As I mention in [README](https://github.com/pixyzehn/stodo/blob/master/README.md){:target="_blank"}, you can use `stodo` like this.

Now I plan to add the following features in near future.  


- Setting .stodo file path. (default path is HOME).  
- Support SwiftPM.  
- Improve code coverage.  

In this case, I can use `stodo`. Cool isn't it?
