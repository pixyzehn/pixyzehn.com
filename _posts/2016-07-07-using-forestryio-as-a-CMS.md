The other day I started using Jekyll, but I was searching for an effective way to write a post.
I didn't take a time to set up for writing. I just want to manage contents by using Github.

I found Jekyll's [Google Summer of Code Project in Jekyll news](https://jekyllrb.com/news/2016/06/03/update-on-jekyll-s-google-summer-of-code-projects/){:target="_blank"}.

> These students are working on a project that fills a huge need for the community: a graphical solution for managing your site’s content. Current plans include a fully-integrated admin which spins up when you run jekyll serve and provides a friendly web interface for creating and editing your content. The server and web interface will speak a common HTTP interface so either piece could be switched out for, e.g. a server which writes directly to a repository on GitHub.

The project includes a graphical solution for managing your site’s content. It looks really good, but unfortunately this is under development, so I have to wait for that.


But suddenly, I found [Foresty.io](https://forestry.io/){:target="_blank"}. It looks like good contents management system for now. It works!! I could import my jekyll blog easily and fast. Also, I can connect Github from Forestry.io. They provide many options for each user.


I hope the following things will be improved in the near future:)

- Still printing the Forestry docs.
- Cannot see preview
- Edit commit message
- Publish function

And there are other CMS platform options here.

- [cloudcannon](http://cloudcannon.com/)
- [siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/)
- etc...
