Today I released a small and simple Todo List iOS app called ["Kigen"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kigen-todo-list-for-reminder/id1198205732?l=en&mt=8). "Kigen"(期限) means a deadline in Japanese.

From App Store description,

> Kigen is a Todo list for reminder. It helps you remind of your important tasks.
With Kigen, you can:  
- Add tasks or notes  
- Edit or Delete tasks or notes  
- Reorder tasks and notes as you like  
- Set deadline as a reminder  
Enjoy your life with Kigen:)

I plan to update this app for learning because now it has a minimum feature:(  
In this app, I introduced [ViewModel with Realm Notifications](https://pixyzehn.com/2017/01/21/viewmodel-with-realm-notifications.html). Thanks to this pattern, I could write tests easily.

Stay tuned.
