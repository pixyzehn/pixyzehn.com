This is the way to create safe `Hashable` based on @rayfix's talk.

In this case, there is no problem here because a hashValue is unique.

`BadPoint(x: 2.0, y: 3.0)` and `BadPoint(x: 3.0, y: 2.0)` are not same object, but they have a same hashValue. This is a problem.

As @rayfix mentioned in his talk, heap allocations are expensive compared to previous way! And looks a little bit ugly:(  
This is what he did to avoid a collision.

This way uses `FNV-1a hash` as a hash algorithm.

> The FNV-1a hash differs from the FNV-1 hash by only the order in which the multiply and XOR is performed

```
hash = FNV_offset_basis
for each byte_of_data to be hashed
    hash = hash XOR byte_of_data
    hash = hash Ã— FNV_prime
return hash
```

The another interesting way to solve these problems is from [Sourcery's AutoHashable](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/blob/master/Templates/AutoHashable.stencil). But Sourcery create `AutoHashable` automatically. Awesome!!
