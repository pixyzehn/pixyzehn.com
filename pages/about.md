<h1>About</h1>

Hi, I'm Hiroki Nagasawa, also known as @{{ site.author }}, and an iOS software engineer at [Doist](https://doist.com). I built [my apps](/apps) for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.

Apart from iOS development and programming, I'm passionate about trekking, climbing, playing soccer, and stargazing with binoculars. I keep track of places I have visited here in <a href="{{ site.links.google_my_map }}">Google My Map</a>.
All views on this website are mine.

You can reach me via <a href="{{ site.links.email }}"><em>hi[at]pixyzehn.com</em></a> and find me on:
