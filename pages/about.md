Hi, I'm Hiroki Nagasawa @{{ site.username }}, and an iOS Software Engineer at [Doist]({{ site.links.company }}).

Apart from an iOS development and programming, I'm interested in a long-distance `Hiking` and `Camping` especially on mountains, practicing `Climbing`, improving my `Productivity`, building something useful mostly with `Swift`, learning `Portuguese`, and reading [books]({{ site.links.goodreads }}).
