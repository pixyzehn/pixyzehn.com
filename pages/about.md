I'm Hiroki Nagasawa and an iOS software engineer at [Doist](https://doist.com), working on [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home) and [Twist](https://twist.com/home). As a side project, I have made [apps](/apps) for Apple platforms.

Apart from software development and programming, I'm passionate about trekking, climbing, and stargazing. All views on this website are mine.

You can reach me via <a href="{{ site.links.email }}"><em>hi[at]pixyzehn.com</em></a> and find me on:
