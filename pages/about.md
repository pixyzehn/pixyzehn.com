Hi, I'm Hiroki Nagasawa @{{ site.username }} and an iOS software engineer at [Doist]({{ site.links.company }}).

Apart from iOS development and programming, I'm into trekking and camping in mountains, doing mountain climbing in a safe way, building something useful mostly with Swift, and learning PortuguÃªs. All views on this website are mine.
