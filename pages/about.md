Hi, I'm Hiroki Nagasawa @{{ site.username }}, and an iOS Software Engineer at [Doist]({{ site.links.company }}).

Apart from iOS development and programming, I'm interested in long-distance `Hiking` and `Camping` especially in the  mountains, building something useful mostly with `Swift`, and learning `Portuguese`.
