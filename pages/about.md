## Hiroki Nagasawa

I'm an iOS software engineer at [Doist](https://doist.com), working on [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home) and [Twist](https://twist.com/home). As a side project, I have made [apps](https://bluecometlabs.com) for Apple platforms as Blue Comet Labs.

Apart from software development and programming, I'm passionate about trekking, climbing, and stargazing. All views on this website are mine.
