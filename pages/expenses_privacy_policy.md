# Privacy Policy

Expenses (the “app”) takes your privacy seriously. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information the app may collect from you. By downloading and using the apps, you consent to our privacy privacy.

## Personal information

The app doesn’t collect any personal information and doesn’t share it with third parties.
Any data you enter is saved directly in your device and synced via Apple’s iCloud services.
We don’t want to access any sensitive data and Apple’s CloudKit technology takes care of it.

## Sharing information

The app uses iCloud sharing to enable users to share expenses. With iCloud sharing, the identities of participants are not made available to anyone who has not been invited to and accepted a private share.

For more information about iCloud, please see the iCloud section in Apple's [Privacy features](https://www.apple.com/privacy/features/).
