# Passwordgen

PasswordGen is a tiny app that will allow you to create a strong password quickly and easily. When you can't simply use a suggested password, the app will also help you overcome password restrictions without compromise, such as only specific symbols are allowed on a website. The app is available on Mac, iPhone, and iPad.
