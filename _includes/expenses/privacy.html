    <p>Expenses (the “app”) takes your privacy seriously. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any
        information the app may collect from you. By downloading and using the app, you consent to our privacy policy.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

        participants are not made available to anyone who has not been invited to and accepted a private share.</p>
    <p>For more information about iCloud, please see the iCloud section in Apple's <a
